I've had interest and curiosity in the cosmos for years, though I haven't studied deeply about it.
<br/><br/>
Since I was young, whenever I was about to sleep and close my eyes, then falling asleep vaguely, I used to see lots of twinkling particles floating in the dark infinite space. They continuously and slowly moved spirally, changing colors from blue to red and red to blue.
<br/><br/>
When I was a kid I feared to seeing it, but growing older, It strikes me that particles might be related to the original memory - the memory of my body which is continuously changing as well as being composed of numerous elements(atoms etc). Although it might be ridiculous and dreaming thinking, in that all atoms in human body are changing wholly in a year as the process of metabolism, can it be possible that my memories of the past stored in atoms(my past body, me from the past!) are scattered all through the universe?
<br/><br/>
Anyway, I no longer fear of that dreaming, rather I am in awe of seeing and feeling the universe through my closed-eyes, but sadly I cannot get in to this memory frequently these days than when I was young.
