Worked with 2 other colleagues.<br/>
The concept is 'express yourself by identifying your own color'. When participants speak through the microphone installed, computer receives data of voices such as frequency and tone. According to those figure, each face captured by the webcam is colored individually.
<br/>
Participants can pick one of cards on board they're interested in, then read texts written back on it. The recitation becomes individual color.
