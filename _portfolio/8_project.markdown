Worked with two other colleagues. <br/>
The concept is ‘express yourself by identifying your own color’. When participants speak through the installed microphone, computer receives data of voices such as frequency and tone. According to these figures, each face captured by the webcam is colored individually. 
<br/>
Participants can pick one of cards on the board they’re interested in, then read the texts written on the back of it. The recitation becomes individual color.
