One of my friend and I worked with it. The concept of this performance was hippie, kitsch, comic and occupy.
There is a joke(believe it or not) in my university about the central lawn. Long ago, when students sat down on this lawn, playing and having a rest, the school's president at that time yell at them "Get out of 'my lawn'!" <br/>
Therefore the lawn has been called "the president's lawn", and the place is always restricted to come in still now. Thus we intentionally get in the lawn and did some funny acts.
