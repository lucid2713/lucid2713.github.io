<i>Mask, performance(solo), 2016</i>

***


<br/>
Mask is composed of series of 2 performances, 1 video, 1 sound installation, 1 audiovisual. <br/>
I took part in 2 performances: one is a sort of dance/movement using sound system made of arduino and pressure sensor. I and three of my friends worked with.<br/>
Another performance is my own solo. Using camera, audio system and handout etc. <br/><br/>
The theme is about the fatigued-society these days, which makes people put on a mask to conceal themselves and makes them justify themselves to endure irrational situation and regard it as inevitable conditions.

The solo performance 'Mask' was motivated by most of current situations that young people(in my age group) are facing in todays society. In the worst job markets, to win the cut-throat competition, young people are forced to to show off, package and sell themselves through one sheet of cover letter. It doesn't matter who we really are or rather people have to hide or cover up their individuality to become the very proper one in this unstable and changeable society.
<br/><br/>
It's awfully painful that confront, criticize, dig into and speak out against this matter, as I'm also one of those who are in that situation and have to find and take my places. Nevertheless I think it's much more distressing not to see what is in back of the surface and just to ignore the problem. So should speak out not to lose ourself and reproduce that kind of society by just integrated into it.
