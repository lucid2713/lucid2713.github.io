As an interactive installation using leds, infrared sensor and arduino, this work was done for final show of 4 weeks workshop ‘Studies in Vibration’ in Berlin on May, 2017. The workshop was one of programs of School of MA(machines, making & make-believe), which is an independent art and technology school based on Berlin, Germany. <br/>

During these 4 weeks, with other participants from all over the world, I had taken lectures about physical phenomena related to vibration, which especially have connection with sound and light. <br/>

I was focused on the vibration as a reaction among each other, so wanted to express connectedness between human and non human beings.
Thus when a person come closer to the balloon flowers, they start to greets him/she by emitting light softly. <br/>

Every moments, our movement makes vibration whether we are recognize or not. And this vibration reaches somewhere. Thus although there is no touch or contact between 2 objects, the connection takes place indeed.
