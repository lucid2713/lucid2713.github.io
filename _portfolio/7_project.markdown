The concept is 'express yourself by identifying your own color'. <br/>
When participants speak through the microphone installed, computer receives data of voices such as frequency and tone. According to those figure, each face captured by the webcam is colored differently. <br/>
Work with 2 other colleagues. I contributed to design and coding(Processing).<br/>
Videos, photos and more descriptions will be upload.
