Color your voice, 2015

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/71.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/73.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/72.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/72.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/73.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/7.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>
