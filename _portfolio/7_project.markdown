The concept is 'express yourself by identifying your own color'. <br/>
When participants speak through the microphone installed, computer receives data of voices such as frequency and tone. According to those figure, each face captured by the webcam is colored individually.
<br/><br/>
Participants can pick one of cards on board they're interested in, then read texts written back on it. The recitation becomes individual color.
<br/><br/>
Worked with 2 other colleagues.
