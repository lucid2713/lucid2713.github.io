<i>Mask, performance(group), 2016</i>

***

<br/>
Mask is composed of series of 2 performances, 1 video, 1 sound installation, 1 audiovisual. <br/>
I took part in 2 performances: one is a sort of dance/movement using sound system made of arduino and pressure sensor. I and three of my friends worked with.<br/>
Another performance is my own solo. Using camera, audio system and handout etc. <br/><br/>
The theme is about the fatigued-society these days, which makes people put on a mask to conceal themselves and makes them justify themselves to endure irrational situation and regard it as inevitable conditions.
