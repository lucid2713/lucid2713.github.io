<i>Mask, performance(group), 2016</i>

***

<br/>
Mask is composed of series of 2 performances. <br/>
One is a sort of dance/movement using sound system made of arduino and pressure sensor. I and three of my friends worked with.<br/>
Another performance is my own solo. Using camera, audio system and handout etc. <br/><br/>
The theme is about the fatigued-society these days, which makes people put on a mask to conceal themselves and makes them justify themselves to endure irrational situation and regard it as inevitable conditions.

Group performance ‘Mask' was especially motivated by the 'Müdigkeitsgesellschaft(The Burnout Society)' by Byung-Chul Hanl and 'Liquid Times' by Zygmunt Bauman. In a society where achievementism, and successism are prevalent, our 'body' is no longer a part of ‘ourself’ but rather a tool for us to exploit and use efficiently. Thus we wanted to express our cries through gestures about the reality that our mind has to brainwash itself with the positiveness and possibility so that we couldn’t(or mustn't) feel tired and exhausted.
<br/><br/>
The four participants discussed about the topic together and expressed their feelings of fatigue and obsession based on their experiences. Three performed movements, and one implemented the sound system. Based on discussion, we created motion, sound effects, background music, and implemented the sensor on the floor. When moving at one’s position, each sound effect on the floor matches for each theme of movement. The awkward sounds of each of performer were aggravated by how we move, or in reverse, our actions became restrained by the sounds.
