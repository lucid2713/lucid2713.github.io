Hi, My name is Min-a Kim.

I live in Seoul, South Korea. I was born in Busan(Korea) and had lived in there until 18 years old.

I studied Sociology and ISC(Information Science and Culture) in Seoul National University.

I'm interested in Art and Technology thesedays, so I'm about to apply to the master's course associated with that field. And I also have interests in the digital society, human-computer interaction, media art and design, digital activism, and environment and ecology.

I'm fond of cooking, drawing, dancing, skateboarding -though not so good at!, and strolling around. I'd like to try new things- whatever excites me. :)
