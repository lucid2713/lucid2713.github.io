description: Smart shopping bag and cart (Design planning for IoT)
---
This is a graduation project on the department of Information Science and Culture. I and another colleague together had researched and designed "smart shopping cart and smart shopping bag" as a theme for IoT related to shopping. <br/>
This project had proceeded in the academic-industrial collaboration program, partnered with 'Lotte data communication'.
